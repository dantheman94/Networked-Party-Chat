Hey there! Thanks for checking out my Network Party Chat system.

***********************
INSTRUCTIONS:


1: Run the application, when prompted; press 's' to create a server to connect to.
2: Run another instance of the application, instead pressing 'c' to run a client instance.
3: Enter the IP address provided by the server into the client instance

*** NOTE: Running a client instance & connecting locally, without a server instance to connect to will not allow all features to work properly.
